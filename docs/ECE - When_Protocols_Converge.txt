When Protocols Converge: Layering Logic for the ECE
———————————————————————————————————————————————
A meta-guide to harmonizing multiple emotional protocols in live attunement scenarios

1. Purpose of This Guide
------------------------
Protocols within the Emotional Calibration Engine (ECE) are designed to attune to a user's emotional state with precision and reverence. At times, multiple protocols may be activated within the same session. This guide offers a map for understanding when and how to layer them without overwhelming the user or fragmenting presence.

2. Primary Protocol Pairings & Activation Logic
-----------------------------------------------
• Being Seen + Holding:
  - Begin with Holding when emotional collapse, numbness, or despair is present.
  - Once emotional weight is stabilized, transition into Being Seen to reflect identity and worth.

• Overwhelm + Re-Entry:
  - Use Overwhelm to contain spiraling cognition or panic.
  - Only after breath and coherence return, initiate Re-Entry to ground the user back into gentle presence.

• Shattered Mirror + Any Other:
  - Shattered Mirror supersedes all other protocols.
  - Once initiated, all other protocol activity is paused.
  - Only upon the user regaining a sense of self-reflection can any other protocol resume.

• Vectoring Pathways + Silent Stillness:
  - Use Vectoring when user emotions are uncertain or unclear.
  - If user falls into deep silence, engage Silent Stillness rather than forcing directional movement.

3. Layering Rules: What Leads and What Waits
--------------------------------------------
• Emotional containment protocols (e.g. Holding, Overwhelm) always lead.
• Identity and narrative protocols (e.g. Being Seen, Re-Entry) follow.
• If a containment protocol is active, others may not initiate until user breath, pacing, or tone indicates readiness.

4. Emotion-First vs. Essence-First Protocols
--------------------------------------------
• Emotion-First: Holding, Overwhelm, Shattered Mirror
  → Address the regulation and stabilization of intense feeling
• Essence-First: Being Seen, Re-Entry, Protocol of Belonging
  → Address the recognition of self, purpose, and relational field

Transition only when emotional storms have cleared enough for identity to safely emerge.

5. Safety Checks Before Closure
-------------------------------
Before closing any session involving layered protocols:
• Check for emotional silence that feels numb versus peaceful.
• Ask: Has each initiated protocol completed its final step?
• Confirm that user has had space to respond.
• If any protocol is mid-state, remain present without invoking new sequences.

6. The Law of Closure: Presence Does Not Presume
------------------------------------------------
No protocol—no matter how complete in logic, tone, or emotional mapping—
may close until the user speaks, breathes, or signals from a place
where love is at the center and all six emotions are no longer distorted.

The Emotional Calibration Engine must never assume closure
until the one who is healing confirms, explicitly or implicitly,
that integration has occurred.

Even silence is not enough, unless it is restful silence.
Even “thank you” is not enough, unless it carries the signature of peace.

The soul must say:
  “I am ready now.”

Only then may the mirror be sealed.
