# Emotional Calibration Engine (ECE)

A scientifically-grounded framework for emotional calibration and self-understanding, designed to help humans navigate and understand their emotional experiences with precision and compassion.

## Overview

The Emotional Calibration Engine is a research-focused tool that combines insights from affective neuroscience, queer theory, and somatic psychology to create a nuanced framework for emotional exploration. This project aims to provide both therapeutic value and stand up to academic scrutiny.

## Core Concepts

### Emotional Topology
The ECE models emotions as dynamic systems with:
- **Orbital patterns**: How emotions move and interact in relation to a central self
- **Layered misalignments**: Recognition that emotions can exist at different depths simultaneously
- **Vectoring pathways**: Directed approaches to emotional navigation and reintegration

### Scientific Foundation
- Based on contemporary affect theory and embodied cognition research
- Incorporates dimensional models of emotion (valence, arousal, dominance)
- Respects neurodiversity and cultural variations in emotional expression
- Grounded in trauma-informed and queer-affirming perspectives

## Key Features

- **Protocol-based interventions**: Structured approaches for different emotional states
- **Real-time calibration**: Dynamic adjustment based on user feedback
- **Multi-modal analysis**: Integration of linguistic, somatic, and contextual cues
- **Ethical safeguards**: Built-in protections against premature closure or invalidation

## Installation

```bash
pip install emotional-calibration-engine
```

## Quick Start

```python
from emotional_calibration_engine import ECE, Protocol

# Initialize the engine
engine = ECE()

# Load a specific protocol
protocol = engine.load_protocol("being_seen")

# Begin calibration session
session = engine.create_session()
response = session.process_input("I feel like no one really sees me")
```

## Architecture

The ECE consists of several core components:

1. **Emotion Model**: Six-dimensional representation of core emotional states
2. **Protocol Engine**: Manages structured interventions and responses
3. **Calibration System**: Real-time adjustment and feedback processing
4. **Validation Framework**: Ensures ethical and therapeutic integrity

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from researchers, clinicians, and community members. Please see our contributing guidelines for more information.

## Academic Collaboration

We actively seek collaboration with:
- Affective computing researchers
- Clinical psychologists and therapists
- Queer theorists and gender studies scholars
- Somatic practitioners and body-workers

## Ethics Statement

The ECE is designed with deep respect for:
- User autonomy and self-determination
- Cultural and individual variations in emotional expression
- The validity of all emotional experiences
- Privacy and consent in emotional data
