# Emotional Calibration Engine - Development Roadmap

This directory contains detailed task lists and planning documents for iterative development of the ECE with your partner.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with `01_MVP_CORE.md`** - These are the essential features needed for a working prototype
2. **Review `04_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`** together - Discuss key architectural decisions and open questions
3. **Use `02_SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION.md`** - For planning research and validation approaches
4. **Explore `03_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md`** - For future vision and advanced capabilities

## How to Use These Lists

### For Development Sessions
- Pick a section from the current phase you're working on
- Create feature branches for each major task
- Update task status as you progress
- Add new tasks as you discover them

### For Planning Sessions
- Review completed vs. remaining tasks
- Prioritize based on user needs and research goals
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Estimate effort and timeline

### For Research Integration
- Use the scientific validation tasks to ensure rigor
- Document findings and insights as you go
- Plan user studies and validation experiments
- Track ethical considerations

## Task Status Tracking

Consider using these markers in the markdown files:
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[!]` - Blocked or needs discussion
- `[@]` - Assigned to specific person

## Additional Files to Create

As you work, consider creating:
- `DECISIONS.md` - Document architectural and design decisions
- `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` - Ongoing research findings
- `USER_FEEDBACK.md` - Insights from user testing
- `ETHICS_LOG.md` - Ethical considerations and decisions

## Collaboration Tips

1. **Regular Sync-ups**: Review progress on todos weekly
2. **Pair Programming**: Complex emotion algorithms benefit from collaboration
3. **User Stories**: Convert todos into user stories for clarity
4. **Documentation**: Update docs as you implement features
5. **Testing**: Write tests before or alongside implementation

## Priority Matrix

### High Priority + High Impact
- Core emotion model
- Safety mechanisms
- Basic protocol implementation
- Privacy protections

### High Priority + Lower Impact
- Performance optimizations
- Additional protocols
- Advanced visualizations

### Lower Priority + High Impact
- Research platform features
- Healthcare integrations
- Community features

### Lower Priority + Lower Impact
- Aesthetic improvements
- Additional export formats
- Advanced customization options

Remember: The goal is to create a tool that genuinely helps people understand their emotions while maintaining scientific rigor and ethical integrity.
