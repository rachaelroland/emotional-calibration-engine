# Implementation Notes & Technical Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Design Principles
1. **Modularity First**: Each component should be independently testable and replaceable
2. **Privacy by Design**: No emotional data should be accessible without explicit consent
3. **Fail Soft**: System should degrade gracefully, never leaving someone in distress
4. **Cultural Humility**: Acknowledge what the system doesn't know
5. **User Agency**: Users always maintain control over the process

### Technology Stack Considerations

#### Backend
- **FastAPI** for async API support and automatic OpenAPI docs
- **SQLAlchemy** with Alembic for database migrations
- **Redis** for session state and caching
- **Celery** for background processing of emotional analysis
- **PostgreSQL** for production, SQLite for development

#### Analysis Pipeline
- **spaCy** for base NLP with custom emotion models
- **Transformers** for advanced emotion detection
- **NumPy/SciPy** for mathematical modeling
- **NetworkX** for relationship mapping
- **Pandas** for time series analysis

#### Frontend Considerations
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety
- **D3.js** for emotional state visualizations
- **WebSockets** for real-time interaction
- **IndexedDB** for client-side session storage
- **Progressive Web App** for offline support

## Key Implementation Challenges

### 1. Emotional State Representation
- Balance between scientific accuracy and usability
- Handle cultural variations in emotion concepts
- Manage the discrete vs. continuous emotion debate
- Represent mixed and conflicting emotions

### 2. Protocol Timing and Pacing
- Detect when someone needs more time
- Avoid rushing through difficult emotions
- Balance structure with flexibility
- Handle interruptions and returns

### 3. Safety Boundaries
- Detect crisis situations without pathologizing
- Maintain boundaries while being supportive
- Handle scope limitations transparently
- Create warm handoffs to human support

### 4. Privacy and Trust
- Implement true end-to-end encryption option
- Allow complete data deletion
- Build trust through transparency
- Handle mandatory reporting complexities

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each emotion calculation independently
- Validate protocol state machines
- Check safety boundary conditions
- Verify privacy protections

### Integration Testing
- Full session flow testing
- Protocol transition testing
- Multi-modal input fusion
- API endpoint testing

### User Testing
- Wizard of Oz testing for new protocols
- A/B testing for response effectiveness
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Cross-cultural validation testing

### Performance Testing
- Response time under load
- Emotional calculation optimization
- Database query optimization
- Real-time session scaling

## Development Workflow

### Git Strategy
- `main`: Stable, tested code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Individual features
- `research/*`: Experimental code
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes

### Code Review Process
1. All PRs require one approval
2. Tests must pass
3. Documentation must be updated
4. Accessibility check required
5. Privacy impact assessment for new features

### Release Process
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Changelog maintenance
- Migration scripts for database changes
- Deprecation warnings for API changes
- User notification for protocol updates

## Monitoring and Metrics

### System Health
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database performance
- Queue lengths

### Engagement Metrics
- Session completion rates
- Protocol effectiveness scores
- User return rates
- Feature utilization

### Safety Metrics
- Crisis detection accuracy
- False positive rates
- Escalation frequency
- User safety ratings

### Research Metrics
- Emotional state change measurements
- Protocol outcome tracking
- Longitudinal effectiveness
- Demographic variations

## Open Questions for Team Discussion

1. How do we handle emotional states that don't map to Western emotion models?
2. What's our stance on diagnostic language and pathologization?
3. How do we validate effectiveness without compromising privacy?
4. Should we allow therapists to create custom protocols?
5. How do we handle potential misuse or dependency?
6. What's our approach to AI explainability in emotional assessment?
7. How do we ensure the tool remains accessible to marginalized communities?
8. What safeguards prevent emotional manipulation?
9. How do we handle data requests from researchers?
10. What's our sustainability model for long-term development?
